# ============ Literature annotation and vote by multiple scores ====	 : 	
Literature          	 : 	phasing locus annotation in the literature overlaps with this contig; True or False
retained            	 : 	Segments were retained if their contig was true in the literature,   
				   and at least 2 of 6 phase scores had q < 0.05  
				   where q = {Howell_ccdf, Howellb_ccdf, Guo_ccdf, Guo_b_ccdf, pval_cdf, pval_b_cdf}
consistent          	 : 	A segment is consistent if its eff_seq is present in at least two libraries.
